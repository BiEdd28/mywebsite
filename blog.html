            random thoughts. Follow me along in this exciting journey through Correlation One!

        <p>I decided to brand my website with my name, which I opted to add at the top left 
          of the page along with the LinkedIn logo which is clickable and will take you to my actual 
          LinkedIn page. I incorporated a top navigation bar with the Home page being the landing page 
          itself and the About Me page which I repurposed from an earlier assignment and this gives a 
          significantly more detailed story about myself. I've added a Blog page which will be used as a 
          journal. The last part of the navigation bar is a placeholder for what is supposed 
          to be a Searchbar.</p>

        <p> I decided to draw attention to the main, future, purpose of the website by using colors that 
          direct the user to fill out the form with a brief description of how they would like my help in 
          designing their own website. Below that I opted to add a brief introduction about myself, the purpose 
          of the webiste and screenshots of the work I've done in class so far. At the very bottom of the 
          page, I wanted to recreate your standard footer with information about the "brand" (hense myself), 
          resources I used, a fake Legal section, and a Lets Chat! section where visitors can email me directly, 
          learn about me and view my LinkedIn page.</p>

        <p>When I started my Software Development course with Correlation One, I actually knew absolutely 
          nothing about web development. To tell you, I had never seen a line of code nor understood how 
          a website was even composed. I was and am still very nervous about my ability to keep up with 
          everyone else as many of my peers seem to have a ton of experience. I'm committed to seeing this 
          through and making a career out of my learnings from this program. 
        </p>

        <p>So far, we have been building up our HTML skills and have recently started practicing CSS. The fact 
          that I am even able to piece this website together makes me excited about my future as some things are, 
          surprisingly, sticking with me. I am wanting to be creative with my approaches to my projects and 
          take quite some time in figuring out how to even start. I hope that in the near future, my web development and 
          design skills become second nature and a strong skill set to leverage my career.</p>
