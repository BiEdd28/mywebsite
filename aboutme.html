        <p>I was born in the year 1994, it was 
          a <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/hn/danl%C3%AD/date/2020-11">fresh</a> Sunday 
          evening. Winter had just begun that mid-November in Danli, El Paraiso, Honduras.
        </p>
        <p>I was raised in Honduras from ages 1-14. Considering how long ago this was, there isn't much that I remember.
          My two younger sisters were born during this time and that changed up my life quite a bit but everything went as you'd expect 
          (attended kindergarten, elementary and middle school). Times did get a little rough when I was 14 and that led my parents to make the
          decision to travel to the US in hopes to live the "American Dream."

      <div class="grid_subtext">
        <p> My teen years were very rough considering the drastic transition. Picture this:
          <ul>
            <li>You left behind all your friends and extended family</li>
            <li>You don't even know how to begin to grasp English</li>
            <li>You struggle to keep up with school because of the language barrier</li>
            <li>Making friends isn't as easy as it used to be because 'English'</li>
            <li>You face the hard realization that graduation is around the corner when your adult life is about to begin and have no head starts</li>
          </ul>
            This was essentially my teenage life but, in the end, I persevered and scraped by just fine.

      <div class="grid_subheading">Work Goals</div>
      <div class="grid_subtext">
        <p>I really broke out of my shell when I graduated highschool. I set high goals for myself but had to start from square one. In the following 2 
          years I went through about 8 jobs trying to figure out what I liked and disliked. I realized that I wanted to further my career but had to stick to
          a single job to save money and do just that. I stuck around for 2 years in DHL (a logistics center) to earn enough and pay through a Medical Insurance 
          Billing and Coding certification but I sadly was not able to land a good job with this and back to the drawing board I went. Given my experience in logistics, 
          I applied to Amazon and have stuck around for 5 years so far. During this time I got to know myself better and decided to learn software programming to eventually
          make this my career and further myself financially.

      <div class="grid_subheading">Hobbies and Things that I Enjoy</div>
      <div class="grid_subtext">
        <p>I really enjoy spending time with my family and going outside the city to catch fresh air and a glimpse of the darker skies - this has become my hobby. Every July, I make an effort to 
          visit Pioche, NV to enjoy the latter. Pioche may have a tiny <a href="https://datacommons.org/ranking/Count_Person/City/geoId/32017?h=geoId%2F3257400">population</a> 
          but it has some amazing night skies.
